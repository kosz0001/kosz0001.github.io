    <main>
        <p>I'm a girl that loves any medium of art. I love music, I love watching movies, and I love traditional art (such as oil or watercolour paintings) but I also love digital art, though I am not a good drawer in any capacity. In terms of music, I enjoy a wide variety. I have a tendency of liking certain songs but sometimes not liking the artist's entire repertoire.I do always joke with my friends that I have two moods for music: <em>on the table dancing</em> and <em>crying</em>. Two very opposite moods. I'm also a big <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan. I recently bough the extended versions of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> on Apple TV so I have them on hand when I travel, despite having seen the movies probably way too many times.</p>
