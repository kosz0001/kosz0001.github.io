        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I enjoy collecting Pokemon cards</li>
            <li>I like to watch True Crime documentaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm a girl that loves any medium of art. I love music, I love watching movies, and I love traditional art (such as oil or watercolour paintings) but I also love digital art. This is ironic because I am not a good drawer in any capacity. In terms of music, I enjoy a wide variety. I have a tendency of liking certain songs but sometimes not liking the artist's entire repertoire. I do always joke with my friends that I have two moods for music: <em>on the table dancing</em> and <em>crying</em>. Quite the polar opposites, I know. I'm also a big <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan. I recently bought the extended versions of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> on Apple TV so I have them on hand when I travel. I have them handy despite having seen the movies probably more times than is deemed healthy.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of travelling. My last really big trip was before the pandemic in 2019 when I joined my cousin's backpacking trip in Asia. I was only able to stay for the leg of her trip that included Japan and South Korea. It was my 1<sup>st</sup> time flying over an ocean. I did go this past summer to San Diego on a solo trip and had the time of my life since there was a heat wave, and I'm tired of being cold. A year ago, I went with a friend to <abbr title="Los Angeles, California">LA</abbr> to see the Kpop group BTS. But honestly, the highlight of that trip was going to Disneyland and Universal Studios. My cousin and I are planning to go to New Zealand for a month after I graduate, and I'm excited to see all the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> filming locations. She's not a fan, but I hope she indulges me a bit. </p>
