    <main>
        <p>I'm a girl that loves any medium of art. I love music, I love watching movies, and I love traditional art (such as oil or watercolour paintings) but I also love digital art, though I am not a good drawer in any capacity. In terms of music, I enjoy a wide variety. I have a tendency of liking certain songs but sometimes not liking the artist's entire repertoire.I do always joke with my friends that I have two moods for music: <em>on the table dancing</em> and <em>crying</em>. Two very opposite moods. I'm also a big <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan. I recently bough the extended versions of <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> on Apple TV so I have them on hand when I travel, despite having seen the movies probably way too many times.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of travelling. My last really big trip was before the pandemic in 2019 when I joined my cousin's backpacking trip in Asia, but was only able to stay for the Japan and South Korean leg of her trip. It was my 1<sup>st</sup> time flying over an ocean. I did go this past summer to San Diego on a solo trip and had the time of my life since there was a heat wave. A year ago, I went with a friend to <abbr title="Los Angeles, California">LA</abbr> to see the Kpop group BTS. But honestly, the highlight of that trip was going to Disneyland and Universal Studios. My cousin and I are planning to go to New Zealand for a month after I graduate, and I'm excited to see all the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> filming locations. She's not a fan, but I hope she indulges me a bit. </p>
